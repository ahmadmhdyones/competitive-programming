- Method 1:
the compiler in C faster than in C++, so that the input&output in C++ are slow than in C and we use the input&output C function scanf&printf in C++ instead of cin&cout when we have a large value of output|input.

- Method 2:
including the following two lines in your main() function:
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
cin.tie(NULL) , cout.tie(0) ;

- Note:
cout << endl  : Inserts a new line and flushes the stream
cout << "\n"  : Only inserts a new line.
cout << "\n" seems performance wise better than cout << endl; unless flushing of stream is required.
