A. Collectively Training (Team):
_______________________________
    - Teams Contest:        We will participate (team members) in a weekly contest and we will work
                            together as usual (like a real onsite contest with 5h duration).

    - Solve Hard Problems:  We will meet (team members / club members) and solve hard problems together

    - Share Knowledge:      We will share together what each one of us have learned individually every week

    - Individuals Contest:  Creating a mashup regularly twice a week, all members will participate individually


B. Individually Training (Alone):
_______________________________
    - Practice Ã— 3:           ((EVERY single day)) I have to solve at least 2-3 problems repetitively

    - Consistency:            On average I have to practice daily approximately 3-4 hours repetitively

    - Blind-Order Training:   Solve problems in sorted order

    - Topic-Based Training:   In the same time you have to practice in Topic-based approach
                              and (solve & implement) on it

    - Online Contests:        Participate in Online Contest on OJs (CodeChef, Codeforces, Topcoder, ..)
