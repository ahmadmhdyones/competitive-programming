1) Never make an assumption which is not explicitly stated in the specs.
There is absolutely no reason to believe that the input is sorted, the graphs are connected, or that the integers used in a problem are positive and reasonably small unless it says so in the specification.

Perhaps you are overlooking a boundary case or assuming something which just ain’t so. Resubmitting the program without change does you absolutely no good. Read the problem again to make sure it says what you thought it did.
